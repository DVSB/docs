Sometimes it is necessary to **manually** migrate a vault.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need *access* to your vault.
A helpful thing for getting access is `KEK <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary*of*cryptographic*keys>`_
Otherwise consider using a :ref:`good password <security/best-practices/good-passwords>`.
