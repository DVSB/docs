# Vaults

With Cryptomator you can create encrypted *vaults*. Each vault is protected by a password and can contain as many files and folders as you like.

You can [create](../adding-vaults/#create-a-new-vault) as many vaults as you like and use separate passwords for every vault.

# Virtual Drives

When you unlock a vault, using your password, the vault's contents will become available as a virtual drive on your PC. Just as if you were using a USB drive.

You can then work on this virtual drive just the same as with any hard drive. Once you're done, you can lock your vault, which will remove the virtual drive from your system. 

!!! tip
    On Windows, you can choose the drive letter of the virtual drive for each vault.

# Synchronizing Vaults with the Cloud

Cryptomator is not a sync tool. You still need the software from your favourite cloud storage service. To sync a vault with the cloud, simply specify its storage location to be inside a directory that will get sync'ed with your cloud. For example, if you're using Dropbox, create a vault inside your Dropbox folder.

!!! warning
    Cryptomator can only encrypt files that you put _inside_ your vault. It will not affect any other files laying around in your cloud folder.
