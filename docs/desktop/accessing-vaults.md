Once you have added a vault to Cryptomator, you will probably want to unlock it, so you can start adding files.

# Working with the Unlocked Vault

After unlocking, your vault's contents will become available as a virtual drive on your PC. This means, that you interact with your confidential files in the same way as with any other hard drive or USB stick.

If you can not find the unlocked vault in your systems file manager (Windows Explorer, Finder, ...), you can always click on `Reveal Drive` in your Cryptomator window:

!!! tip
    On Windows, you can choose the drive letter of the virtual drive for each vault via the advanced vault options.
