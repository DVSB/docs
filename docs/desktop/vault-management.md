# Remove Vaults

You can remove a vault from the vault list by right clicking on the list entry. This is only possible while the vault is locked. 

!!! hint
    By removing a vault from this list, it is **not** deleted from your filesystem. You can re-add the vault afterwards.
    
    To irrevocably get rid of the vault, you can simply delete the vault directory (which contains your `masterkey.cryptomator` and the `d` directory) using your normal file manager.

# Reorder Vaults

You can change the order of your vaults by dragging them to the desired position.
