# Requirements

## Java

Java 9 or newer is required. If you don't already have Java, we recommend installation of the [Java 11 JRE via AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot){: rel="external"}.

To verify you meet the minimum required Java version, you can simply invoke the following command via your command line interpreter: `java -version`
